Stanley: Oh, god, I’m sick of Zooms… 54% now, I don’t know what I’m gonna…

Thom: What is this?

Stanley: This is some- this is, this is analytics.

Thom: How many followers has he gotten?

Stanley: (sighs) Hundred thousand… It’s kind of embarrassing. 

Thom: (exasperated gesture)

Stanley: It’s- I know, I know.

Stanley: It’s more like… he belongs to the era of Myspace. He’s just not…

Thom: What do you mean, like us?

Stanley: Well… yeah. Alright.

Thom: Mm.

Stanley: I don’t think… I don’t think we can carry on with him.

Thom: I can’t even fucking remember why we started it, really.

Stanley: (exasperated sigh)

~~~

Thom: Hello.

Stanley: Chieftain!

Mews: How are you gentlemen?

Thom: Hi!

Stanley: Chieftain…

Thom: Yeah.

Mews: And you’re looking very well.

Thom: Umm. So, uhhhhhhhhh…

Stanley: It’s a bit tricky, really.

Thom: So listen…

Stanley: Yeah…

Thom: Yeah. We, we, we love what you’re doing… 

Stanley: Yeah…

Mews: That’s very kind of you.

Stanley: (Gives two thumbs up)

Thom: You obviously have been trying… very hard… And we appreciate the effort… 
But umm, we have been looking over the numbers.

Stanley: We have. Well, /we/ haven’t been looking over the numbers. We’ve been… directed to look at the numbers.

Thom: Well, we’ve been given a print-out of the numbers.

Stanley: Yeah. We got a print-out, of-

Thom: Yeah.

Stanley: -of the numbers, and one of those numbers is… Forty-three point two…

Thom: What’s that number?

Stanley: That’s, that's forty-three point two thousand… Which is, uhh, I believe what your views are... down to... now. 

Mews: They fluctuate!

Stanley: You said- You, you actually said-

Mews: You can’t just look at one post. 

Stanley: -you could get a million followers in the first month.

Mews: A million VIEWS. 

Stanley: How long have we gone?

Mews: I- I didn’t say followers.

Stanley: How long have you been on TikTok, Chieftain?

Thom: Every time… a new post goes up… 

Mews: It wasn't a million followers.

Stanley: [??] go down.

Thom: …you get 30% /less/ people viewing it. 

Stanley: We've-

Thom: So, clearly, it’s not going in the right direction.

Stanley: No.

Thom: Clearly, you either needed to do something… more like dogs dancing, or whatever the fuck it is.

Stanley: There is literally a dog in Croydon who’s got more followers than you.

Thom: Yeah, totally.

Stanley: People on TikTok, they’ve, they find you… I think the word is, “repellant”… uh... and…

Thom: (exasperated sigh)

Mews: Well, that’s unfair…

Stanley: …”Creepy”. “Creepy uncle”. They called you a creepy uncle.

Thom: It’s a /fucking/ disaster!

Stanley: It’s a disaster.

Stanley: We’ve, we’ve got some of the comments. Some of the things that people have said.

Stanley: It’s probably [not your fault. Don’t even look at them].

Thom: (To Mews) Have a listen to this. (To Stanley) Actually, read, read some of it.

Stanley: (reading) “This isn’t how you use… TikTok.”

Thom: (exasperated sigh)

Stanley: (reading) “This isn’t going very well.”

Thom: Yeah, no shit.

~~~

Thom: We're in a difficult position... You've promised us, that you could... give us a stronger identity on TikTok. 
You know, promote the music, get us back into the marketplace. But instead, you've just become... a source of acute embarrassment.

Stanley: Yes... That's... that's right.

Mews: I feel like such a fool. I've let you both down.

Thom: It's not your fault, it's- it's nobody's fault! No, it's- it's, uh, it's the times!

Stanley: The times have changed.

Thom: These are not the 90's anymore, is it?...

Stanley: No...

Thom: Fuck sake...
