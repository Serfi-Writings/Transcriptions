[Introduction]

Adam: ♫ Rosie is squatting on the grass and doing a poo. Now she has concluded, and she's joining me and you... ♫ 
♫ She is looking frisky, pleased to be outside at last. It's been quite grey and rainy, but now that's all in the past... ♫ 

Wow... what a song! It just came to me, and, just flowed right out of me. It was like I was channeling it. 
An extraordinary musical moment to kick off a podcast, which features a conversation with an extraordinary musical man. Look, I'm getting ahead of myself, I apologize.

Hey, how're you doing, podcats? Adam Buxton here. Hope you're doing well, it's a blustery day out here, in the country fields of Norfolk, UK... in, mid-July, 2020.

And, I'm gonna lay some facts on your ass about my guest today. For Podcast #128, guitarist Ed O'Brien, who, I'm glad to say, is a friend of mine. 
I've known him for... well, properly I've known him for about 15 years now.
Here's some Ed facts for you: Ed, currently age 52, met his Radiohead bandmates in the mid-1980's, while attending Abingdon School in Oxford, though they didn't settle 
on the name that made them famous until they were signed in 1991. Though their first album, "Pablo Honey," featured the outsider anthem "Creep," it didn't prove to be an 
indication of where the band was headed musically.

I remember beiing quite sniffy about Radiohead in those days, until Louie Theroux made me a tape compilation in 1996 - I still have it, I dug it out this morning - and 
it's called "Buckey Bollocks." And on one side, it's a compilation of artists like The Rentals, The Adults, Souls of Mischief, Roy Ayers, Gravediggaz, Marvin Gaye, and 
Shooby Taylor - fist time I heard Shooby Taylor was on that compilation - and on the other side was the whole of "The Bends," by Radiohead, which came out the previous year 
and totally passed me by. Side One is labeled "The Bends," and Side Two is labeled "The Schmends." I liked "The Schmends," but I loved "The Bends." 
I was onboard from then on. "The Bends" was engineered and, partly produced, I think, by Nigel Godrich, who would produce 1997's album, "OK Computer," and thereafter help 
propel the band to the outer reaches of experimental yet accessible alternative rock for years to come.
 
So far, band members Thom Yorke, Phil Selway, and Jonny Greenwood have all made solo albums; Ed is the latest member of the band to do so, and he, as a solo entity, 
goes by the initials EOB; his debut album, "Earth," was released this year, 2020, in April.
 
My conversation with Ed was recorded in a nice studio at Universal Music's headquarters in London's Kings Cross back in early March of this year, a couple of days before 
the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Ahhh, that was the good old days, when the concepts of "social distancing, "flattening the curve," 
and of course, "lockdown" was still sexy, fun, and exciting. 
 
Just saying the opposite of what I mean there. Nevertheless, Ed and I managed to avoid the subject of the c-word and rambled on instead about embarrassing Radiohead videos, 
stolen MiniDiscs, and whether the band that made "OK Computer" really were as intense and anxious as the 1998 documentary "Meeting People Is Easy," directed by Grant Gee, 
suggested. We also talked about getting cosmic, the romance of space, whether Ed really is the 59th greatest guitarist of all time, and why he felt compelled to step out 
from the shade of Radiohead's mighty creative umbrella.
 
This is absolutely great music journalism I'm doing here... but we began by slightly rehashing and updating a bit of the conversation I had with Ed about ten years ago, 
which was the last time I interviewed him.

Back at the end, for links and waffle, mmm; but right now, with Ed O'Brien. Here we go!

[Ramble Chat Music]

6:01
Adam: We talked before, ten years ago, when you came on and did the show I was doing for 6 Music; Big Mixtape...

Ed: Yeah... I loved that, and you laughed at some of the early names of Radiohead.

Adam: That's right! Whirligig!

Ed: Shindig!

Adam: Shindig! [laughs]

Ed: [laughs] Used a bunch of leprechauns, sort of...

Adam: That's right! Dancing around a 4-foot Stonehenge monument.

Ed: Exactly, yeah... I know, I- I still, when you mentioned it, I still laugh at it.

Adam: Yeah, Shindig, with waistcoats and horn players.

Ed: I was actually telling somebody this yesterday, saying that, and, and it was at the same time that we had a country rock phase, yeah...

Adam: Like Rodeohead.

Ed: R- Very good...

Adam: Well there is a band-

Ed: There is a band called Rodeohead, right yeah.

Adam: -Yeah, who do very good country covers of Radiohead songs.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: So, ten years ago, though... and what did we talk about? We talked about coming back off tour, and making that adjustment from being pampered and having a very strict 
and easy-to-follow routine-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -to coming home, where all bets are off and the responsibility is once again yours to actually conduct yourself in a mature and responsible way.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And that is- I mean, I was marvelling at your ability to do that. 

Ed: Or, maybe not-ability, but it was also a time when- you remember ten years ago, when all our children were little.

Adam: Yep.

Ed: And it was that thing that you get back off tour, and rightly... you know... my wife-

Adam: "/My wife!/"

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: Trying to phase that out...

Ed: I love that, you can't phase that-! I love it! But, I didn't want to put on that little voice! [laughs]

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: I love it! So, my wife, Susan, was at the end of her tether! She'd been holding the fort down, and you're gonna imagine, you wait for - in fact, the first time, when my 
youngest, Oona, was born, six months later, I was off touring America for six weeks.
And you get back off tour. And, of course, her instinct is to pass over the kids, and say, "Right, /you/ get up!" And of course, you're not prepared. And it's those moments, 
isn't it? So it's five days, and you're, you know, like you said, you've been pampered...
Everything's given to you, and your life is sorted out. And then, you pick up the pieces, and - I actually look back on those times - because it was, you know, I'm - of course 
it wasn't tough, but it was challenging at times. 

Adam: I think you're allowed to say it's tough.

Ed: Am I allowed to say that? 

Adam: Everything is relative, alright? 

Ed: Ok. [laughs]

Adam: We take it as read that you and I are the beneficiaries of privilege in all sorts of ways.

Ed: Yes. Yeah.

Adam: But, there are certain things that are... immutable truths, and one of them is... house politics, domestic politics; it's tough, whichever way you s[ide]... I bet 
Jeff Bezos has his days of difficult domestic politics that people could sympathize with.

Ed: D'you think so?... Yeah, no, I think you're right, they - uhh - I'm sometimes, you know, because of the feeling like you've - you know, "I've won the lottery ticket," 
uhh well, you know - that you're reluctant to say, "but yeah, it was tough;" but actually... 
I look back on those times, and I /really/ value them, because... I think, like... those moments of rawness, as a father, and, as a family - it's not just as a father, 
it's a - and those moments when the shit's hitting the fan... [laughs] You don't know what you're doing, and you just hold on.

Adam: The shit, the vomit...

Ed: Yeah, the v- you know, the whole thing! And, you're feelng like the worst dad in the world!

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: All of that stuff, and it's sometimes, literally, you just have to hold on. And I look back at those times with great affection. 

Adam: Mm hm?

Ed: Real affection, and that kind of- particularly because now the kids are teenagers; same with you, right? 

Adam: Yes.

Ed: That whole time, that... lack of sleep, all of that, that uncertainty, and... I, there's a kind of magic to it, right?

Adam: I guess I look back at those times... with mixed feelings, because I... did go through so much angst about...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...being, a not very good dad...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...A not very good husband... not very- just not very good. 

Ed: Did you feel quite young? When you look back on it, do you think you were a kid? Do you look back on it and go, "That was a, that's another era"?

Adam: When I look back on it, yeah!

Ed: Yeah, yeah.

Adam: I can't believe- you know, I was in my... late twenties when we had our first child? And I just think, wow, I was a boy!

Ed: Yeah, I know. It's funny...

Adam: A boy-man! 

Ed: It's f- [laughs] Boy-man!

Adam: You know, it's so weird when... you know, you're legally an adult at 18...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: I think of my - no disrespect to my... soon-to-be-18-year-old son - but he is NOT an adult! [laughs]

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: And he would be the first person to admit it!

Ed: To admit it! Yeah!

Adam: He is in some ways, like...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...he's wonderfully mature, and thoguhtful, and...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: So, in many of the important ways, he's very grown up. But in all sorts of other ways, like... come on, mate, you're not gonna be anywhere close for another ten years!

Ed: Well, it's funny, isn't it? Because you always think - I think, like, the previous decade, I think, "Oh..." You know, "God, I was still a kid when I was in my early 
forties," almost; it feels like a different person, I wonder whether, you know, when I get my sixties, I'll go, "Haha, the fifties, I was really...!" 
You know. I wonder whether that it's just that accumulation of knowledge, and experience, and hopefully wisdom, that you... yeah.

Adam: Yeah. I think it must be. And then, yeah, you just sort of go, [old person's voice] "I've done it!" And then you die.

Ed: [laughs] Yeah!

Adam: [old person's voice] I've reached maturity... Ack!

Ed: [laughs] And then that's it.

Adam: Yeah, you just implode.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And, ten years ago, band-wise...

Ed: Yes.

Adam: You've just done "In Rainbows"...? 

Ed: "In Rainbows" came out in 2007...

Adam: -2007, right.

Ed: ...So we were... in the throes of doing... "The King of Limbs." 

Adam: Doubling up on drummers...

Ed: Yeah, I mean... Clive didn't join us, he only joined us on tour, but there was lots of, you know, sonic chicanery and wizardry going on with the drums, and, that album 
was a process of... we'd done "In Rainbows," and that had been such a kind of tonic for us... well, at least, the release of it was.
There was sort of like, we had fire in our bellies again, and I think that we really wanted to go in and make another record, but, the truth of it was, we were kind of 
bored with our instruments, and that was what The King of Limbs was about, kind of putting down the traditional instruments and just trying to jam, and make music in a 
different way, looping stuff, and... Serato software, which is the stuff you use with- DJs use, and using, all sorts of stuff, and that was fun; you know.

Adam: Yeah, because... I can't remember if it was you, or... maybe Jonny, or, maybe I read it in an interview... The consensus seemed to be amongst the band that [for] 
pretty much every record, you came close to breaking up, in one way or another.

Ed: Oh yeah, [laughs]

12:20
Adam: Just because the way you worked was so... intensive, like, when those MiniDiscs came out, last year, when they were... bootlegged, stolen, whatever happened.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: These are the MiniDiscs, sixteen hours' worth, thereabouts, of "OK Computer"... demos...

Ed: They're Thom's MiniDiscs!

Adam: Right.

Ed: Yeah. 

Ada: What, did he leave- uh, uh someone hacked a computer with them on, right?

Ed: Yeah, I think all our stuff has been- basically, most of the Radiohead stuff has been archived.

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: And... somebody just hacked in on the site, and, you know. It's in the cloud somewhere.

Adam: And then the guy that did it...! There was a rumor around that he was trying to shake the band down for a hundred and fifty grand.

Ed: He was! Or, auction it to the highest bidder. Something like that.

Adam: Right, ok. I read that he complained bitterly; he said, "No, I didn't!"

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: He said, "All I was gonna do was sell it to the fans!"

Ed: Ok, that was it! Yeah exactly, to the highest bidder!

Adam: Yeah!

Ed: [laughs loudly] Oh well done, you!

Adam: So he thought he was...

Ed: Well, that's alright, then!

Adam: ...highly principled, because he wasn't trying to bribe the /band/...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...it was just the fans he wanted to rip off.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: But anyway... I was one of those people that eventually bought them when Radiohead themselves said, 
"Well, look... Why don't you pay for them, and then you can download them legitimately; we'll give the money to Extinction Rebellion..."
So, I found them really quite interesting! I saw you the weekend that it happened, I think?

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And you said, "Ahh God, some guy's hacked these MiniDiscs, and they're all about to come out... We're not sure exactly what's going to happen..." 
And I was thinking, "Ooh, I'd quite like to listen to those!"

Ed: [laughs loudly] You didn't say that at the time! [laughs again]

Adam: No, I was trying to be cool! But I, you know, I'm a fan, and... and...

Ed: Of course! They're interesting, right?

Adam: Yeah, /really/ interesting! 

Ed: Yeah!

Adam: And they /were/ really interesting!

Ed: Yeah!

Adam: They're sort of my ideal thing to listen to, in a way.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: A weird combination of... songs... They almost sound like a Guided by Voices album, you know...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...Kind of scratchy recordings of songs, and then maybe a little bit of... something that Thom's recorded on the tube in Japan, or something...

Ed: Yeah, yeah.

Adam: Weird... collage of sounds... and then, a very nice Nigel Godrich version of No Surprises, or whatever, which is a bit different to the one on the album. 

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: It's uh, kind of brilliant!

Ed: Yeah! And it's interesting, because... we were all recording at the time, and I think... I heard some of the live stuff that Thom had recorded on his MiniDisc from that, 
and I was like, "Oh, wow! That's what he was hearing!"
Because his recorder was set up between him and Jonny, and, we were in the round. I was on the other side, and that- I was just like, "Oh wow, that's what it sounded like," 
because sometimes in that rehearsal room - because it was quite loud - if Thom and Jonny were on the other side, I couldn't necessarily hear them, and, at such volume, because 
there was me and Coz on my side or whatever like that. So it was, uhh... there's some good stuff, because you can see, like, how a song like "Paranoid Android" came to be.

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: You know, the putting of the parts together. Or, "Karma Police"...

Adam: The thing to do would be to do a massive edit.

Ed: Exactly! Where you put it together, almost like you did a Dolby Atmos version. Put it-

Adam: Surround version!

Ed: Surround version! Yeah! [laughs]

Adam: Yeah, with all you guys in holograms.

Ed: Yeah! [laughs] That's it! That's the future!

Adam: But you know what I mean, as a fan, like, with those MiniDiscs, the temptation is to just to spend a couple of weeks chopping out your favorite bits and make the 
ultimate compilation. 

Ed: Right.

Adam: The way I did when the Beach Boys released all that Smile stuff in the early 90's for the first time.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: All these segments. And I just spent... /weeks/...

Ed: Really?

Adam: ...making different compilations of permutations of it, or, you know.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And it was great fun!

Ed: It's great.

Adam: But I'm always meeting, you know, musicians and artists of all kinds who get quite frustrated with people like me because it's like, well... it's somewhat antithetical 
to the appreciation of the "art."

Ed: I, I kinda think that's...

Adam: That's the argument.

Ed: I, yeah, and I think that's a bit bullshit. 

16:04
Ed: You know, my own personal point of view is, I like to see the humanity behind the musicians, and... 
I don't know, I've always liked that whole... "dispelling the myth," and- you know, I did a blog for, uhh, when we made "Kid A," and someone was reminding me about it the 
other day. And the reason I did it, I- it was when we first had the Internet in like 2000, and every night, I would do... kinda dispatches from the studio.

Adam: I remember, I used to read it.

Ed: Right! And my whole idea was, I wanted to dispel the myth that there was kind of this magic sorcery going on.

Adam: Because... yes, that was Magic Sorcery Central. 

Ed: Yeah! [laughs] 

Adam: For the band.

Ed: Which you visited, yeah.

Adam: Well, I didn't know you at that time, when you were doing all that stuff, but I knew Nigel Godrich.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And there was /so/ much mystique around Radiohead... And, after "Meeting People Is Easy" came out, it looked as if, "Wow, this is a unit that's going to implode... 
pretty soon."

Ed. Yeah.

Adam: And there's a very sensitive, fragile... person at the center of it; and then, it must be very difficult for the people...

Ed: Mm hm.

Adam: ...around him; and I've heard you talking before about the fact that /that/ was a hard time for you as well.

Ed: Yeah, it was a hard time, but I think, uhh, you know, we deliberately constructed this kind of... this mystique. Because that was in a response to... "Pablo Honey."
And the fact that, [laughs] we really hadn't got our shit together, and we looked a bit all over the place, and... you know, some of the photoshoots in America were 
a bit weird, and, all of that stuff. And, I remember like, when it came to "The Bends," the second [album], well, who do we look towards? Well, we looked towards the 
West Country, towards Massive Attack and Portishead, really. And they had this incredible mystique, you know. They were /uber/ cool, you know, the way they did their 
videos, and you could construct this. So, it was partly self-preservation, but it was also partly as a response to, really, kind of, looking a bit naff altogether, 
and kind of not having got that stuff. And I mean, [with] the first album, we hadn't got our shit together. We didn't know quite, really, what we were doing.

Adam: No, there's some very funny stuff... *cough*

Ed: Yeah. [laughs]

Adam: ...floating around. What were those videos? We did a Bug Special, and there was a video with you guys in an empty pool or something.

Ed: Yeah, "Anyone Can Play Guitar"...

Adam: Yeah... [laughs]

Ed: [???] with turkeys, and... what, those feather boas, that...

Adam: That's right.

Ed: And I remember kind of, you know, like very proudly sort of showing - because I was living with my dad at the time - and, I tried to go, "Dad, look what we've done," 
and he was sort of standing there, laughing! Going- going like, "Well what the fuck is this?!" [laughs]

Adam: "I'm not proud of you, son!"

Ed: Yeah, exactly! [laughs] He's very good - and there's another one called "Stop Whispering"; we did this video with this guy called- director called Jeffery Plansker, 
and it was in LA.

And, umm... he was giving us the spiel, and we were sort of lapping it all up, and he said, "I feel this sense of alienation in this song, and this guy's going to become 
more alienated as the song goes on, and the way I'm going to represent this is by putting on an old, like, diving bell on him,
and that's juxtaposed against some footage that we shot in this industrial, post-industrial spot that's full of asbestos...

Adam: Right...! Yeah, these big rusty girders!

Ed: Yeah, you remember! Ok, so all of that, and... [laughs] I don't want to put Jeffery down, but... he thought he was like Dino De Laurentiis; look, you could see it 
go to the guy's head! He was riding around in an open shot Jeep at 5pm finding new locations! And he'd find a spot, and I remember he had Phil and I, kind of... balancing 
this pincushion, and he, he kind of pulled us in, and the direction, very quietly, was, "Guys..." - and there was some hat pins in there - and he said, 
"Just... make it your own."

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: And, Phil and I started to- no no no, and, I could hear the hushed tones of people going, "Isn't Jeffery a genius...?"

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: So, you get this video, and I remember playing it, you know - because you kind of, you know, there's a uncertainty when - you, you basically knew it was pants, 
but you didn't want to admit it. 
And then, of course, you go and play it to your dad, and your dad's laughing, and it's all sort of - "What's with the guy in the diving suit? Why is he suddenly in the picture?"

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: And it's like, "Oh yeah... I- yeah, why /is/ he there?"

Adam: Do you remember, Not the Nine O'Clock News, "Nice Video" showing about the song?

Ed: Yeah. It's very... [laughs]

Adam: There was a classic "Nice Video"... it was a perfectly nice song...

Ed: It wasn't!

Adam: No disrespect!

Ed: No. It was pretty crap.

Adam: But it was massively pretentious.

Ed: Yeah, it was SO pretentious, and that was- that's kind of that stage when you didn't- you know, you didn't know to go "No." 
Then, once "Pablo Honey" came out, a lot of the time, in Radiohead-land, 90% was saying "No." "No, no. We're not going to do that." 
And that's very important, because that means you have a sense of self. You know what's right, you know what... feels right, you know what you want to portray. 
That was very much like, "How do you want to be percieved?"

Adam: Was Stanley Donwood involved at that point?

Ed: Not in "Pablo Honey," but he was - him and Thom - because, I think, the cover art and the artwork proess was a little fraught for Thom on the first record, so... 
him and Stanley had been to college, so they worked together on The Bends cover, and that was the first one that they did together.

Adam: Right, so that's kind of an important part of... figuring out a visual aesthetic.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And then that sort of feeds back into everything the band does. That's a really nice part of the whole symbiosis with Stanley...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...often working in the studio while you're playing, [which] I remember he was doing...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...during In Rainbows.

Ed: It was great, and, you know, I knew Stanley because he was Thom's fire-breathing friend from Exeter. 
And then he joined us properly in the studio around "OK Computer."
You know, he's with us every single album since then and been on our travels, and he's just such an important part of the whole process, because you know- remember, 
our old studio, which we've now sold, but it's [???]; while the control room had this, um, mezzanine-level, if you like, this kind of - it's an old converted barn - and, 
it was almost like... the gallery up at the top, and Stanley would set up shop there for a while.
And, you used to hear, like, at 11 o'clock at night or something, he'd go, "I don't know ANYTHING about music, but this is fucking great!" 
You know, he's such a really important part of the process, and... yeah, just, he made it more three-dimensional, really.

Adam: Yeah, but then your strategy of making yourselves mysterious-

Ed: Yes.

Adam: -and creating-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -an ambience and everything, sort of worked too well-

Ed: Yes.

Adam: -in tandem with, you know, a very good album, and an album that felt mysterious in itself, you know... So, the whole "OK Computer," the strangeness and the mystery 
of so much of that music-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -plus... "Meeting People Is Easy," plus, all these journalists telling you that you're all geniuses...

Ed: Well, the funny thing about "Meeting People Is Easy" is, Grant Gee's a lovely guy; that tour... it's one perspective, because every time Grant turned up on tour - he 
wasn't there for the whole tour - we'd be having a miserable time. But actually, we had a lot of fun on that tour as well.

Adam: What, you were all just dancing around and going, "We're the kings of the world!"?

Ed: Well- [laughs] Not quite! You know what we're like! Yeah! We weren't that celebratory... But, you know, deep down, it was great to feel like you'd made- or relieved, 
in a way... I think it was more relief that you'd made a really good album, and that you thought was a really good album, and that people were connecting with it.
So, it- it was a very, very funny time, because, you know, that all those things, it all comes to a head, I think, for all of us in different ways... It came to a head, 
and obviously, it's quite... apparent with Thom, and quite open with Thom, and... you see that in the doc, and, you know, he- it comes out in his lyrics, and, the way he 
performs, and stuff like that, but, I think it came to a head with all of us in certain ways, because, I think... it's that thing where... You know, when you've got... 
for want of a better word, shit, you know... you think that being in a great band and having a great album will solve all of that stuff.

Adam: Uh huh. 

Ed: You know, you think that, "Oh, that's the thing that'll make me happy!" Well, when you get that, and you realize it doesn't make you happy, I think that's when, you know. 
It's a really good thing to have gone through, because it was... you know, it forced me to look at myself, which was a great thing, you know. Not easy, but I... you know, 
I look back on it as, you know, we were kids! I mean, and that's the other thing, going back to that thing... It felt like we were kids.

Adam: And I think you, especially if you've... been in a band most of your working life..

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: You get to your late thirties - not just being in a band, but being an artist, being, you know, living a certain, quote, "unconventional lifestyle," 
or whatever - There's much less pressure to achieve a certain level of emotional maturity.

Ed: Yes. [laughs]

Adam: [laughs] In fact, the reverse is true! 

Ed: [laughs] Yeah.

Adam: And so... yeah, you can v- you know, it's no mystery why so many of these people come off the rails!

Ed: Yeah, no, for sure. And all the things that were on the riders, and the, the- you know, it can be the cliché party, if you want it to be.

Adam: Yeah, yeah.

Ed: But it wasn't- actually, it wasn't the cliché party; in fact, it was the antithesis for Radiohead, because we were so, sort of... You know, we didn't want to fulfill 
any kind of bad rock and roll stereotypes.

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: But, you know, we had our own foibles.

[Music break about slow WiFi]

Adam: Congratulations!

Ed: Thank you!

Adam: You've done a record-

Ed: Thank you!

Adam: -and it's not an embarrassing stinker!

Ed: [laughs] Thank you, Adam! [laughs] "An embarrassing stink...!"

Adam: [laughs] Well, the, the press release; yeah, I'm reading your press release... 

Ed: "It wasn't a..." 

Adam: ...and it's making me laugh, and it's- just the wording of it...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And this is quoting you: "'Thom, Jonny and Philip - from the band - are making music,' Ed says. 'And I'm like, the last thing the world needs is a shit album by me.'"

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: And then the next line is, "But suddenly, a switch was flicked!"

Ed: Oh, no! That's so-

Adam: "And the songs came pouring out of him!" But I misread it, as, "But suddenly, a switch was flicked, and this shit came pouring out of him!"

Ed: [laughs loudly] Yeah. That sounds about right.

Adam: But- But it's not, man. It's- congratulations-

Ed: Thank you.

Adam: It's really lovely-

Ed: Thank you.

Adam: -and, what it definitely demonstrates is your cosmic side. 

Ed: Great. That's good.

Adam: And, you know, it's called "Earth"...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: It's got a sense of the cosmic in so many ways...

Ed: Yeah, yeah.

Adam: It's beautifully... atmospheric and moody; it reminds me of one of my favorite albums: "Apollo" by Brian Eno-

Ed: Love that.

Adam: -in some ways.

Ed: Well, you- it's interesting you say that, because, for me, music is very visual; and one of the things, for me, the perspective [of the album] is, 
music from space; I was obsessed with how music might sound from space.

Adam: Right.

Ed: And I saw this... One of the songs is called "Mass."

Adam: Yeah, that's one of my favorite ones.

Ed: So that was... I took the kids to see this film called "Hubble," which was made by NASA, at the IMAX down at Waterloo. Like, you know. Filling a morning, you know? 

Adam: Oh, yeah, yeah yeah...

Ed: And it's a 50-minute film about when NASA recommissioned the space shuttle. And they recommissioned the space shuttle to fix the Hubble Space Telescope.

Adam: Mmhm.

Ed: Anyway. The guy who fixes it is an astronaut who'd I'd met and kind of befriended called Mike Massimino.

Adam: Wow...

Ed: And I'm watching it, and suddenly - because they're- all the crew's shots is there - and I'm like, "Oh my god, I know him! That's Mike Massimino!"

Adam: Where'd you meet him, in space?

Ed: [laughs] In Houston, of course!

Adam: Oh!

Ed: Backstage, at a gig, in 2012... I get introduced to him, and, he shows me a photo of him in one of the space shuttles with a copy of "In Rainbows."
And his daughter, Gabby, had given it to him, because he had said to his kids, "I'll take something into space. What d'you want to take?" 
And his daughter was a Radiohead obsessive! So she [said], "Can you take my copy of 'In Rainbows'?"

Adam: Oh, wow!

Ed: Yeah, and he's an amazing guy. 

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: He's like this... New Jersey... lovely, warm, big guy...

Adam: "He's a fuckin' space man!"

Ed: [laughs] Yeah.

Adam: "Yeah, what d'you want?"

Ed: "What d'you want"...!

Adam: "I'm floatin' in fuckin' space, here!"

Ed: Yeah... [laughs] And his book is amazing, it's really inspirational.

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: And so I take the kids, and you see this footage of him fixing the- the arm on the space shuttle has got the Hubble, and they're orbiting around the Earth, 
of course, as he's fixing it... And the view of the Earth below is /just/ extraordinary. It's /so/ beautiful. I was so moved by it, and I became obsessed with this kind of, 
the view of space in the bigger picture; and also... Do you know the "Pale Blue Dot"?

Adam: Yeah, Carl Sagan.

Ed: Carl Sagan. So, that was the working title for the record. That's what I wanted to call it.

Adam: Right.

Ed: Because again, I came across that about... six years ago. And, that image of the Earth... And, those incredible words that Carl Sagan writes to complement this tiny dot, 
this speck of dust that you see in this photo, and this arrow, saying, "This is our home, this is it."
So, for me, the perspective on the record, was, it was the micro and the macro. So it was going right down, but it was also pulling right out. 

Adam: Yes; it's almost as if the tracks are sequenced so that it's an alternation of that.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: You sort of- We start; the first track is called "Shangri-La"...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...and it sounds like you... having some... 

Ed: Party.

Adam: ...great-great party fun... at Glastonbury.

Ed: [laughs] Yes, sounds right.

Adam: And then... You got Brasil-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -the second track, which is this... massive, epic stuff; soft, lovely, folk-y...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...finger pick-y, and then... [it] turns into this big-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam -sort of rave...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...track, almost.

Ed: A cosmic rave.

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: Great video as well. And then, yes, you've got these tracks like Mass, which is the one that reminded me of Apollo most.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: A kind of mood piece.

Ed: I'm really still obsessed with that thing of... the sounds of space, and there's really interesting- I've, I've been reading a lot of stuff like- I, I was reading 
about the great- God, I've got that age where you know you're trying to recall, you know...!

Adam: Sure, mate. Yeah, I'm glad it happens to you too.

Ed: [laughs] Isosceles triangles, that's all I can think of, that- Pythagoras!

Adam: Ok.

Ed: Yeah. Pythagoras, he was a really interesting guy. He talked about the music of the spheres. Like, each planet had its note, had its frequency. 
So I was really kind of interested in that, and I love those NASA recordings of each planet, which is really interesting.

Adam: What do /they/ sound like?

Ed: ...It's sound!

Adam: But what- what, like, what's making the sound?

Ed: Well- I think what they've done is, they, it's- its-

Adam: Is it... radio frequencies, or something?

Ed: Yes, radio frequencies, an interpretation; and they've kind of... they've translated the frequencies into sonic waves; or something, I'm not quite sure, I-

Adam: Sounds like bullshit to me, man.

Ed: [laughs loudly] Yeah, well I like that shit, don't I? [laughs] I lap that stuff up.

Adam: [laughs] Yeah...

Ed: And, for me, as a guitarist, I actually think... I realize in many ways, Eno is... more of an inspiration. You know, when people say, "Who's your guitar heroes?"
I mean, he didn't play guitar, but... Sonically, always what he did...

Adam: Yeah, I love that sound... Because you forget, with "Apollo," half of it is kind of science-fiction moodscapes...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...And then half of it is almost like, this quite sunny... country music, like, spacey twangy stuff.

Ed: Yeah. Yeah.

Adam: And it's great.

Ed: It's great, and I love that, just that sort of juxtaposition of those two.

Adam: Yeah, yeah.

Ed: So that, for me was- uh yeah that, that's music from space.

Adam: And when did you start getting... cosmic?

Ed: ...You know I've always been slightly cosmic, right? [laughs]

Adam: Yeah! Yeah, you've got more- I think you've got more cosmic...

Ed: I've got more cosmic! I've been licensed to go more cosmic... So, listen... [laughs]

Adam: I like it!

Ed: When I was at school... It wasn't a cosmic time in the 80's, right?

Adam: No!

Ed: It was anti-cosmic.

Adam: Yeah, anyone who said "cosmic" was a...

Ed: I know.

Adam. ...a wanker!

Ed: I know, and- Exactly. And I was... in the Smiths gang, which was... /very/ anti-cosmic.

Adam. Yeah. [laughs]

Ed: [laughs] You know, we're '84 Miner's Strike... You know, very feet on the ground.

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: So... I- It was always there, and then, it kind of, you know... It gets suppressed down... 

31:53
Ed: And I think what happened with the whole acid house thing, and the whole rave culture... That, that opened the eyes again, and...

Adam: Yeah, yeah.

Ed: ...and the veil. D'you know what I mean? I mean, I wasn't fully immersed in it, in a way that- because I had the band, and that the band for me was everything, and... 
You know, I wasn't gonna go out and get munted every other weekend. But I did occasionally, you know, do it. And that had a profound effect, and that whole...
I think that went in deep.

Adam: Mm. I mean, I've heard people who... and even academics... talking about the value of psyhedelics, and things like that?

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: In terms of... connecting you to something important.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And in terms of stripping away a lot of stuff that isn't important. I'm too nervous... I don't think I'm a psychedelics person.

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: I've only had... err, one experience...?

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: With mushrooms...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...at, at university... And that went BADLY!

Ed: Yeah. [laughs]

Adam: I mean, it started out going ok.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And then... I looked in the mirror, and I... didn't feel connected to the reflection.

Ed: Wow.

Adam: In the mirror.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: Have you ever had that?

Ed: No.

Adam: I think it's called... a sort of fugue state.

Ed: Right.

Adam: It's like, I've read that it happens to some people when they take mushrooms-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -not everybody.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam. ...It was really, really alarming. It was like I was looking at a clone.

Ed: Yeah, that must be scary.

Adam: It was so scary.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: But!... Maybe what I was experiencing was some form of ego cancellation.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...So I no longer felt connected to... a physical...

Ed: Yeah, maybe...

Adam: ...version of myself.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And so I should have been celebrating and dancing around and going, "I'm free! I'm free!"

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: But instead I was thinking, "Why is there a clone in the mirror?! /That's/ bad!"

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And then I went to the toilet, and my knob had shrunk to the size of an acorn...

Ed: [laughs loudly]

Adam: [laughs] Which can also... 

Ed: Well that's not good, isn't it...

Adam: Have you had that?

Ed: What, with mushrooms?

Adam: Mushrooms!

Ed: I can't... say that that's been...

Adam: It doesn't sound like it.

Ed: I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't- no, but, but, you know, I'm not dispelling that, I, it's not something I've-

Adam: It's not something I would brag about. I wouldn't make it up.

Ed: [laughs loudly] No... I'm sure... [laughs] That's interesting.

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: I, the only, exper- I once got spiked at Reading Festival.

Adam: Ohh...

Ed: In a year we didnt play... Uhh, someone gave me some acid, and I... and I, I remember... I was just like, "Well, what's going on?"

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: And, I had an amazing night! [laughs]

Adam: Oh my god... That's my worst nightmare...

Ed: I kept, I kept looking in the mirror and thinking I was Elvis Presley! [laughs loudly]

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: But it's a classic bad drug story, I can see it. Umm. I think you're... They're not for everybody, these things.

Adam: No.

Ed: And- they're really not.

Adam: No, and if you have... you know, I don't know- I might well have... undealt with...

Ed: Exactly.

Adam: ...issues...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: I'm... almost certain I do.

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: And... yeah, if you were ever to do them, I think-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -the people I've heard extolling their virtues in a sort of academic sense would always-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -be doing them in, in a controlled environment-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -with people who know exactly what's happening.

Ed: Well, you know, they're using MDMA and mushrooms; they're doing a lot of controlled dosage for PTSD. You know-

Adam: Right.

Ed: And lots of- And, they're having incredible results.

Adam: I've heard- treatment of addiction, I've heard, as well.

Ed: Yeah, totally.

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: And my experience of all of those things, are... that what - that expression - it gets you "out" of your head.

Adam: Yes. 

Ed: And so you get a perspective of yourself, which is, often... a really important thing.

35:17
[Music Break]

35:50
Adam: Sometimes I thought to myself, like, maybe... my obsession with ~space~, and sci-fi, and that kind of Bowie-eqsue "Space Oddity" thing of...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...alienation, and the romance of space travel... I would say... You know, to generalize... that is a kind of a typically /male/ thing. 
To fantasize about being out in space, on your own... Floating around in a tin can... And the romance of that, and also... the kind of romance of missing everybody on Earth...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: It's a bit like being out on the road, perhaps.

Ed: Like the pioneer; you know, being the great explorer.

Adam: But it's also a kind of abdication of responsibility.

Ed: [laughs loudly]

Adam: Meanwhile, your wife, or your partner, or whoever- 

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -is back on Earth-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -doing all the fucking hard work!

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: And you're out in your tin can, going, "I'm romantic, I'm floating around, I'm so alienated...!"

Ed: Yeah yeah, yeah. So, my perspective on that is slightly different, because my perspective, probably... formed a bit more like, "2001[: A Space Odyssey]." That cosmic scene.
And, my favorite film of the last twenty years, [which] I think is genius, is "Interstellar."

Adam: Mm, I love it.

Ed: And- don't you? And, for me... it's like... I'm thinking, in space; and I talked to Mike Massimino about it, because I'm like, going, "Mike... I wanna go into space 
with you." And I know I say- every time I say this, I've said, "I really want to go into space some time, and, I wanna go with you." Because we talked a lot about, about how 
it feels up there, and how you feel...
He talks about this "spiritual connection" - and a lot of astronauts do - so it's not a feeling of "alienation," and "isolation." It's a feeling of incredible connection.
Have you hard of this thing called the overview effect?

Adam: ...No...?

Ed: It's a phenomenon that astronauts have. Generally, they go up to space, and they look down on the planet, and they feel this incredible /love/ for the planet and this 
connection for Earth - our home. And it's not like, uhh, ♫ Sitting in my tin can... ♫

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: It's big, open-hearted... "Fucking hell..." People come back very, very changed, and he talked- Mike says, "If we could send all the leaders up to space," you know...

Adam: Yeah... Have any of them gone up and... done drugs?

Ed: [laughs] Oh, god...

Adam: I mean, you wouldn't... you've probably... That would be over-egging the pudding, wouldn't it?

Ed: That might be- That's a double dose! That's... That's... Why? Someone will-

Adam: [laugh] Someone's gotta go up and have some drugs!

Ed: You know, once they do the commercial airliner thing, there'll be some people, won't there? There'll be, there'll be-

Adam: Drug tours!

Ed: "Drug tours"... 

Adam: Yeah...!

Ed: Oh god... Jeez...

Adam: Did you see "Ad Astra," with Brad Pitt?

Ed: Yes, yeah.

Adam: That's quite good, isn't it? Did you enjoy that-

Ed: I... 

Adam: -one...?

Ed: No...

Adam: I mean, it's not- I would hesitate to recommend it, but-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -I thought maybe you would have dug it.

Ed: I started watching, because I thought, "This is right up my strasse." I love-

Adam: Yeah. Dad issues...

Ed: Dad, dad issues... I just- 

Adam: Space...

Ed: There was something about it that just felt-

Adam: Brad Pitt...

Ed: Yeah, I know, and he's great. I just thought it was a bit wooden.

Adam: It's not the best. It's quite clunky. But-

Ed: Yeah. 

Adam: There were elements to it that I thought were quite brilliant, and...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: There's a sequence in the beginning where Brad Pitt's character, whose dad is Tommy Lee Jones...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And he's like, far out in outer space, and he's gone rogue... and Brad Pitt has to go and, and sort him out.
And... the first leg of his journey is to go up to the moon, where he's gonna take a shuttle off to Mars, or something.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And this is in the future, when space travel has been... turned into a... industry. And so, he goes up on a Virgin shuttle...

Ed: Yes. Yeah.

Adam: ...to the moon.

Ed: That's right. Exactly.

Adam: And it's really nicely done, and-

Ed: That's good.

Adam: -it's, it's like "2001."

Ed: The detail's good.

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: I thought all that detail was great-

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: I just thought... that there was something lacking in there.

Adam: No, ah, I mean the, the actual story... There's this, there's this- I don't wanna spoil it, but, there are several sequences... [laughs]
There's one bit where he, um... They- I don't think this is a spoiler-

Ed: No. [laughs]

Adam: If you're someone that cares deeply about spoilers, maybe you should switch off if you haven't seen Ad Astra. But... if you're normal... then... [laughs]

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: Uhh, there's one bit where... Brad Pitt has to... He wants to get inside a rocket. But the rocket's taking off. So he climbs up the side of the rocket...

Ed: ...No!

Adam: While it's taking off...

Ed: ...No!

Adam: ...and he opens the door and he gets in!

Ed: That's preposterous! That's-

Adam: And I don't think that that's possible!

Ed: No; that's kind of like a space version of "The Dukes of Hazzard." That-

Adam: Yeah...

Ed: -they're like, trying to get into the General Lee, otherwise it's going off-ramp...

Adam: Jump through the window...

Ed: Jump through the window! [laughs]

Adam: I know, it's like, "Ok, I understand..." It's a science fiction film.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: It's a bit of entertainment.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: But-

Ed: No...

Adam: That's the line, you-

Ed: I'm not having that.

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: I switched off before that, so I'm really glad...

Adam: Oh, ok!

Ed: Because, I've got to that stage with films now; like, if I'm not feeling it, I give it an hour, or so. And then it's like, "Ah, well, I'm not gonna watch this." 
You know, I know I- you can tell fairly quickly. 

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: So I'm really glad I didn't see it through to its...

Adam: Oh, it gets more ridiculous than that...

Ed: Really?

Adam: Yeah, yeah...

Ed: Whereas, I have to- I'm sorry, but... "Interstellar" is... I love- I could watch that every week.

Adam: Yeah, I mean, that's mad as well.

Ed: It is mad, but, isn't it based on... cutting-edge science?

Adam: By stoned scientists... [laughs]

Ed: [laughs] You're so silly... I'm laughing it up!

Adam: "Hey... hey, man... You know, like... it would be possible..."

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: "...if you, like- j-just go with me here, for a second..."

Ed: I love that!

Adam: I love it too...

Ed: I mean, to me- I know, but, to me, I love it so much, and it kind of resonates on a way that I feel like - and I'm probably wrong, here - but I can feel like, 
almost the - it's based on this kind of, almost like these scientific truths.

Adam: Uh huh.

Ed: You know, I- however preposterous it might seem, and that whole thing of the mirrors, and the different dimensions... Oh my god, I just...

Adam: I dug it, I loved it.

Ed: I- Yeah.

Adam: And, you know... The bit where McConaughey's watching his daughter...

Ed: Ohh my god...

Adam: The age... I mean, I can hardly describe it without... wanting to cry.

Ed: Oh my god! And as- and as a parent, as well!

Adam: Yeah, yeah...

Ed: I, I think it's interesting because, for me... I think... I know, I got a bit obsessed, and I read about it, and I mean, obviously, Kubrick, "2001," played a really 
important part, possibly, for Christopher Nolan...
But, it's interesting when you go back to Kubrick, now, because I used to think... I mean, in fact, when Radiohead made albums, I'd once say to you like, we wanted to be 
like the Stanley Kubrick of the musical world. Like, Kubrick would make... You know, "2001"... And then he'd do "The Shining," or what- You know, you'd do all these different 
types of-

Adam: Right. 

Ed: Different-

Adam: Distinct-

Ed: Yeah, and kind of-

Adam: Experiences.

Ed: Yeah, distinct experiences. When you go back to the Kubrick stuff, what's so interesting, [is] that Kubrick's is very, very, cold, and male.

Adam: Mm hm.

Ed: And it is like that sitting in that tin can. It's a very male- I did that whole thing with Susan, I said, "We should watch "Dr. Strangelove!" I remember that being 
brilliant! I love that film. Genius, right?" And I watched it with her... And you know when you're watching with somebody who's going like, "Where are the women in this?"

Adam: Mm hm.

Ed: You know, I was like, awakened to the fact that, "Oh, yes... Of course, he was in an era..." Everything is very, very, male. You know, the whole making of the film is 
very male. The protagonist is a male. Whereas, Christopher Nolan... There's this beautiful balance, and this love... between a daughter and the father. And that idea of love; 
for me, the message is, you know, love transcending dimensions, love as this kind of... actual force within the universe.

Adam: Mm...

Ed: And for me, I, I really love that whole thing of... you know... Kubrick, who was obviously a master at what he did... but where we are now, with someone like 
Christopher Nolan, where he's... There's so much humanity.

Adam: Yeah. Kubrick pushed the... kind of antiseptic; it was almost as if... emotions... were a sign of weakness...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...and had to be "eliminated..."

Ed: Yeah! [laughs]

Adam: ...to make the whole thing "pure," somehow... 

Ed: Yeah, yeah.

Adam: ...and to make it clinical, and, "symmetrical..."

Ed: Yeah!

Adam: ...and "beautiful," and... which he /did/, you know...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: That's not to say that there aren't... emotions and feelings that are inspired by watching those Kubrick films.

Ed: No.

Adam: They're subtle... and, they're strange... but they're definitely there. But yeah, I mean... "Interstellar," that's raw...

Ed: That's right on it. And it-

Adam: Being stabbed in the gut...

Ed: Yeah-

Adam: Pain...

Ed: And to put that in space, and to kind of like, into a, into a cosmic kind of existential setting, is just... genius.

Adam: Mm... It was, it's such a brilliant observation, as you say, of... a very particular pain that comes with... watching your children; it's like... the experience of 
being a parent is an exercise in relativity, in a way, because... your sense of time is so different to theirs... 

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And it's so cruel how fast it is for you, as an adult...

Ed: Yeah... [laughs]

Adam: ...and it's so... tortuously boring and slow for them.

Ed: [laughs] Yeah, yes...

Adam: And yet, you're just seeing it whiz before your eyes... 

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...They're changing from one week to the next...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...and, you film a video of them being incredibly sweet; I had this video I shot of my daughter when she was abut five, or something, talking about animals.
...And, it just used to break my heart very time I watched it, and as I was watc- it began to be too painful to watch it, because I... felt that it was speeding away from 
me so fast.

Ed: Yeah, I know, I know. I know.

[Music Break]

45:37
Adam: I'm going to pivot...

Ed: Yeah, let's pivot.

Adam: Do you get wound up- ah, I've gotta stop going on about this... 

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: But, umm... do you get wound up when you're listening to... Oh, I listen to this sort of, news podcasts and things, especially American ones.

Ed: Mm.

Adam: And when the correspondent comes on- and so they say... "Mike, you've been following the, uhh... presidential caucuses out there; how's it going?"
And they - to a man/woman - have to begin the sentence with: "So."

Ed: "So."

Adam: "So-" 

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: "It's going fine... but-" Anyway, no, I'm going to shut up...

Ed: No, the one that gets me, is not "So." It's "Listen."

Adam: "Listen."

Ed: Tony Blair /always/ used to do that.

Adam: ...Yes, he loved "Listen!"

Ed: I... /fucking/ hate that! -"Listen." And it-

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: -Yeah. "Listen." And, Australian cricketers do it as well.

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: It- There's something really... ah, sinister about "Listen."

Adam: I know what you mean, it's like, "You don't understand."

Ed: "You don't understand. Listen. Listen to /me/..."

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: ...It's so HORRIBLE!

Adam: I know Blair always did it...

Ed: Yeah. He always does it!

Adam: And maybe... he always did it, but I started becoming aware of it... during the war, you know.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And it was big... "listen" time.

Ed: "Listen" the whole time.

Adam: "Listen. Listen. Listen. It's not that simple. Listen. We're all going to have to... go in and... bomb some people. Listen."

Ed: Ugghh...! That is horrible, isn't it!

Adam: Yeah...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: Anyway, "So" is not that bad.

Ed: Yeah... "So" is not as bad as that.

Adam: No.

Ed: "So."

Adam: "So." But it's people wanting to- it's, it's in the podcast era... I think.

Ed: [laughs] Right. 

Adam: It's everyone wanting everything to be a... a story...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...a narrative...

Ed: Ok.

Adam: ...and... putting "so" at the beginning of a sentence kind of makes it, I think, sound superficially more like, "Ohh, this is a- we're telling a story here!"

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: Rather than... You can just start a sentence by saying, "Well," you know, if you don't want to get hard into the sentence.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: Ahh, that's my problem. I've got other problems...

Ed: [Peter] Gabriel had an album called "So," didn't he?

Adam: That's right, "/So./"

Ed: "So." [laughs]

Adam: That's how it was pronounced, yeah. "/So./"

Ed: "/So./" [laughs]

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: "/Sledgehammer.../" [laughs] Great album.

Adam: Oh, he's great. 

Ed: Yeah. Yeah, great.

Adam: He's cosmic, isn't he?

Ed: He's... definitely cosmic; a lot of musicians are cosmic.

Adam: Yes!

Ed: It goes with the territory!

Adam: Because they don't have any real responsibilities! [laughs]

Ed: Aww! [laughs] Probably, because we're free of the shackles of... reality!

Adam: Yeah, exactly... 

47:45
Adam: Speaking of...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...the shackles of reality...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...and your job.

Ed: My job.

Adam: And, speaking of ten years ago-

Ed: Yes.

Adam: Which was the last time I sat down and talked to you...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...on mic... Around that time, I didn't realize... but David Fricke of The Rolling Stone magazine-

Ed: Mmm?

Adam: You know Dave Fricke, yeah?

Ed: Ah, I saw him recently! At a gig, he came to one of my gigs!

Adam: Yeah. He's a cool guy, I like him!

Ed: Yeah, I love David!

Adam: He pops up on a lot of the music docs I like, and he - for people who don't know what he looks like - he looks like...

Ed: One of The Ramones?

Adam: Like the nerdiest member of The Ramones.

Ed: He's such a great guy. And he has such /love/ for music! It's like, he never gets bored of it! He's got such a lovely energy, and he- he's interested in musicians.

Adam: And, he obviously likes you! Because, you turned up - this was in Rolling Stone Magazine 2010...

Ed: Right.

Adam: You turned up in the list of "100 Greatest Guitarists"!

Ed: Ugh... :/

Adam: And, I think it- I mean it did say "David Fricke's picks..." 

Ed: Right. Ok, yeah.

Adam: So it wasn't claiming to be a definitive list.

Ed: Ok that's- yeah, that's very lovely.

Adam: But...

Ed: [sighs]

Adam: Inevitably, those lists are always framed as- or read as...

Ed: Yes.

Adam: "Here's a definitive list!-"

Ed: Yes.

Adam: "-of the greatest guitarists of all time!"

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: Or, "The greatest comedians," or "The greatest-" whoever...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And of course, it's- it's meaningless.

Ed: Of course.

Adam: Really.

Ed: Yeah, we know that.

Adam: But... still quite nice to pop up; do you remember that list?

Ed: No, I never, I-

Adam: You don't... seek those things out?

Ed: I don't seek li- No, I, I stopped reading interviews and all of that around the time of "OK Computer" because it was kind of like, "It was so good," and... I didn't like 
the effect it was having on me. 

Adam: Right.

Ed: It was making me feel better about myself. I was so kind of senstive to it, and if it was bad, it's gonna bring me down, so just... do it.

Adam: Leave it alone.

Ed: Leave it- Leave it alone. 

Adam: Good idea. 

Ed: Yeah. Anyway, what- where am I?

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: [laughs loudly]

Ed: What [ranking] am I?

Adam: What d'you reckon?

Ed: Oh, God...! I just- [laughs] "'it an 89 with a bullet!" I don't know, what?

Adam: ...59!

Ed: No; really?

Adam: Above... -No, you see, you already like it!

Ed: No, no, I don't really...

Adam: Above... Jonny Greenwood!

Ed: NO!

Adam: Who's number 60!

Ed: You are kidding!

Adam: Also above-

Ed: That's not right.

Adam: Angus Young...

Ed: No.

Adam: ...96; Bert Jansch?...

Ed: -WHAT?!

Adam: ...94; Robby Krieger...

Ed: No...

Adam: ...from The Doors, 91; 

Ed: That's- yeah.

Adam: Joan Jett, 87; Neil Young(!), 83...

Ed: ...Woah!

Adam: Dave Gilmour, 82; Joni Mitchell, 72; Lightnin' Hopkins... it- all of these people, you are above.

Ed: I'm a fraud.

Adam: Link Wray; Mick Ronson, 64...

Ed: Mick?!- Oh my god...!

Adam: It says, "Ed O'Brien. Radiohead's two lead guitarists-"

Ed: I'm not lead guitarist...

Adam: "-have a symbiotic relationship." Well, you're... you're, two lead guitarists.

Ed: Why, no, Jonny's the lead guitarist. I see myself as kind of like, the sweeper role. Like, th- that's a football analogy that you won't know about. [laughs]

Adam: Ok.

Ed: It's sport-ball.

Adam: Right, alright...

Ed: [laughs] And the sweeper's the guy who's like, between the- the defense, and takes the ball up- the defense, up, up the field or whatever.

Adam: Ok.

Ed: So it's kind of like, between rhythm and sound, and... I mean, yeah; I mean, it's preposterous, I- it's good, though, but I don't- I'm not even embarrassed about it, 
because it's just not something that-

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: -that bears any relevance to truth.

Adam: No; it's nice, though.

Ed: But it's nice, obviously. Yeah. I mean, I think as well, the other thing is -listen, about Radiohead, it's like... you know...
I've always felt - I, I think I've always been open about - I've always felt... deeply insecure about my playing, compared to Thom and Jonny's.

Adam: Mm hm.

Ed: They're incredible players!... And I've always felt, myself, if I'm honest, slightly inferior! 
So, my... People like Eno are so important, in terms of sound and stuff, because, Eno's not, like...

Adam: He's not a virtuoso.

Ed: He's not a virtuoso, and I'm not a virtuouso. And... th- the people that I really loved as guitarists, were people like Will Sergeant from [Echo &] The Bunnymen, 
Johnny Marr from The Smiths, The Edge... They /can/ be virtuosos, if they want to be, but they chose not to be. You know. So... they were kind of like my yardsticks.

Adam: Mm.

Ed: And, Thom and Jonny were always, like- for me, I've always held them up in, really high esteem.

Adam: [It] continues...

Ed: Uh oh!

Adam: "Jonny Greenwood is closer to a traditional lead man..."

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: "Those are his unwell bends at the end of 'Just' and 'Paranoid Android'..."

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: "O'Brien likes the wacky noises; the ghostly above-the-nut jangle-"

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: That's nice.

Ed: "Above the nuts"...

Adam: "Above-the-nut jangle"...

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: "On... 'OK Computer's' 'Lucky,' and the high, reverberating pops on 'Hail to the Thief's' '2 + 2 = 5'... are also Ed's handiwork."

Ed: ...Wow! I mean, I think- amazing, he listens to that in depth! I mean- it's funny, I- [laughs] I met somebody recently, in Australia, who... They're the Australian... 
Radioheads. And, the guy comes up to me, and he goes... "I'm you."

Adam: Oh, wow! [laughs]

Ed: "I do your stuff!"

Adam: What're they called?

Ed: Uh- I can't remember, sorr-

Adam: They don't have a joke-y name?

Ed: They /do/ have a jokey name, but of course, I've forgotten it. And...

Adam: Radio-mate.

Ed: And, and I'm- I'm like, amazed. And he said, he said: "I find your stuff /really/ hard to do..." 
And I'm like, "Really?" And I'm just... I'm always astonished that someone would listen. Because I- I never listened to my part, as... a bit. 
It's... all about the song in its entirety. It's always serving the song; it's the whole thing. I mean, that's why I think these things are a bit unfair, because... 
Really, when somebody is singling you out, they're not, because it's... the collective sound, a lot of the time.

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: So- Yeah. I'm always surprised when people actually go, "Oh, ah yeah, that sound..." I'm like, "Oh [really]- oh wow? You noticed that?"

Adam: Yeah. 

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: Oh, I think people do. At number one...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: Who do you think is number one?

Ed: Umm... for...

Adam: It isn't [???].

Ed: No... Ok. Is it... Jimmy Page?

Adam: ...No!

Ed: Is it... Ok, can I have a couple of guesses?

Adam: Yes. 

Ed: What would he do; would he go for- well, Hendrix!

Adam: Yes....

Ed: Yes, of course, sorry. I should have gone straight in there.

Adam: ♫ Jimmy Hendrix ♫ - Number One.

Ed: Yeah. Number Two?

Adam: Number Two? Duane Allman. [laughs]

Ed: Oh, ok! I wouldn't've-

Adam: I mean, that's- that's eccentric, I would say; that's-

Ed: Yeah, that's... that's...

Adam: No disrespect to the mighty...

Ed: ...Duane Allman.

Adam: ...Duane Allman. Uhh, and number three: B.B. King.

Ed: Ok; is Clapton in the top ten?

Adam: Yeah, I think he is.

Ed: Prince?!

Adam: ...No!

Ed: He doesn't?-

Adam: -He doesn't place...!

Ed: /NO/!

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: Prince, was, the motherfucker.

Adam: Right...!

Ed: Him, and Hendrix; I think- I mean, when you watch... footage of Prince play guitar... it's extraordinary. 
And you know that footage at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

Adam: Yes!

Ed: When they're playing "While My Guitar Gently Weeps?"

Adam: Yeah... And then he... does the mic drop!

Ed: Yeah...! [laughs]

Adam: Or- the guitar drop at the end!

Ed: The guitar drop! And Danny Harrison's face - George Harrison's son - is like, "What the...!" And they're-

Adam: Yeah, it's amazing, it's amazing.

Ed: It's extraordinary!

Adam: I know, people shared it; I- I'd never seen it-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -and then, people shared it... after he died-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -and, I saw it for the first time, and it was...

Ed: He was the greatest, and, I- I think for me, like... like, him and Hendrix; because Prince had that... that, that /funk/, and he could do that /clean/ funk, as well.

Adam: Mm hm.

Ed: They played "Kiss" on the radio this morning, and it was just like, "...Oh my god." Even that- just the, just the [warbling guitar noises], you know, just... amazing. 

Adam: Yeah; he was extraordinary.

Ed: Yeah.

54:26
Adam: Umm... I want to ask you...

Ed: Yes.

Adam: Before we... conclude.... One of my questions was...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: Why make a solo album, Ed?

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: Specificially...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: There's so many reasons-

Ed: Not to.

Adam: -as a guitarist in a very successful band...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: ...not to.

Ed: Yes.

Adam: Especially a successful band where you are- whatever you do, as a solo entity, is gonna be compared to-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -some extremely... good... stuff that you've already done-

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: -as part of this unit.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And... who needs that grief?

Ed: Yeah. Well; it's a good question, and I- it actually stopped me for years, doing anything... because, I- I like, you know. 
It was just like, well, "I don't need to do anything else." And- and I think... 
For me, you see, there was always... I've always felt a bit of a hole... you know; with all the success, and all the fantastic creativity within Radiohead... 
There was always, for me, there was always something missing, and I didn't know what it was; I thought it was just me; y- you don't realize...
And the moment I started writing, it was the most compelling thing. 
Going into your shed, and then coming out five hours later with something that... I thought was- had- sounded beautiful!... And so... you then get to surgery; 
you have- you demo it, and it becomes... 
...I think, it- it's a really good point, then, it's- and, and then, I, I like, I've had- 
Listen, I've had dark nights of the soul on this, like, "What am I /doing/? Why am I... Why am I stepping out-?" 
And that's usually because I'm tired, or I've been, you know, working on it for too long. 
It's not... a rational thing? It's a completely intuitive thing; it's like... a feeling, it's like, "How-" Listen, if I didn't do this...

Adam: You're... Tony Blair-"listen" there.

Ed: OH, did I do a "listen"? Oh, noOOO!

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: Ohh-! Tch! Just- just bleep that out! Sorry! If I didn't- Awww... 

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: That's- Aww, that's awful...

Adam: Sorry I'm making you self-conscious...

Ed: Yeah. [sniffs] If I didn't do it... I wouldn't be me. And that's, that's all I can say. I'm completely pulled in- and I've started thinking about the second record... 
Uhh, for me, the last week has been amazing, because I've... I've kind of connected with where I think I wanna go...? 
I've had to double-check myself a lot...? I'm like, "Is this right? Is this-" because, you know: "Why am I- Why did I not do this twenty years ago? Why am I doing it now?"

Adam: Mm hm!

Ed: And, I don't know, and then, and then, I- it's that thing, you get back to, there's a kind of... there /is/ a mystery; there is a /magic/ to music as well, 
and... maybe... you know, you get the calling, sometimes? 
You know, the- the ancient Greeks used to see it as a kind of a calling, and the Muses, and... put it in those kinds of terms, and... 
You know, it happens to different people at different stages in their life, and, for me, this is happening now, and it's... I'm constantly out of my comfort zone, 
which is the best place to be! It makes it- ehh, you know. Nick Mason from Pink Floyd has this lovely expression; he said to me, he said, 
"Well of course, we can all be at home, feeding the peacocks!" You know?

Adam: [laughs] 

Ed: [laughs] And he probably does have peacocks. 

Adam: Yeah...

Ed: But, it's that, you don't... To answer your... question in a... short way: I think, if you /are/ gonna do something outside of Radiohead, you have to be /absolutely/ 
sure that it's the right thing, and you feel that, and there's a power to what- you know, there's a, there- it, just, feels so right.

Adam: So it's not an exercise in... staking your independence, and-

Ed: No... 

Adam: -and saying-

Ed: No, I, I- No! And you- I don't know if you- but I, I've always been the opposite. 

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: I've always hated that idea of the ego guy- "Well, I /should/ do something because the others are doing-!"

Adam: Yep!

Ed: I- I've got nothing to prove! I haven't got a competitive bone in my body; I'm not like that! And, for years... it was... Radiohead; which... was... [it] absorbed 
my whole creative... part of me. And it was my family.
And I was /so/ happy, and I didn't have time for... for anything else. And then, this music comes along, and it's... "Oh! Wow! This is..." I, it's like, being pulled! 
Yeah. That's how it is.

Adam: Mm.

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: And then, do you have a sort of unspoken contract with the rest of Radiohead that you're just... never going to refer to your solo [work]? 
Is that the way it works? Like- 

Ed: [laughs]

Adam: Or do you guys listen to each other's side projects and comment on them, or is it easier if you just don't? 

Ed: I think we listen to one another's projects, but no one really comments. I always hopefully say like, "I- you know, really like it..." I think... you know... 
Thom was saying at the last meeting, he said, "Oh..." 
Someone came up to him and said "[Suspirium]" was... the, the best song that Thom had ever written, and Thom was like, really surprised, 
and I said, "Well, it's a fucking great song!" 

Adam: Mm.

Ed: You know, it's amazing! You know, Radiohead is not... we're not like this big support unit, going like, "You GOT this!"

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: "Well done! You got this!" You know? We're not-

Adam: High-fiving...

Ed: High-fiving! "You got this! I /LOVE/ your work, man! You got this! You are /SO/ strong! This is /YOUR/ moment!" 
No, it's not at /all/ like that. [laughs] And you /know/ it's not! [laughs loudly]

Adam: [laughs]

Ed: It's all... It's all like- Everybody's very nice... 

Adam: "Have you heard Eddie's album?"

Ed: Yeah! [laughs]

Adam: "What did you think of it?"

Ed: [laughs loudly] Yeah, I /know/ there's that stuff going on, and I'm sure there's...! 
And listen, I've had to- one of the things I had to do, was, I had to let go of what I thought the others would think of it.

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: Because there was a part of me when I started the record... I put... my "Radiohead" head on. And it's not appropriate for this record.

Adam: Mm hm.

Ed: And... so I had-

Adam: Yeah, there's only one track I thought- that "Banksters," was the-

Ed: Yes, the only one! Only one that's... vaguely Radiohead, right?

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: And I had to get- because this record is very much more... 
I mean, if anything, it, like- there's a cosmic- but it's really, for me, it's like, lyrically, it's more, comes from my kind of gospel, soul thing.
That's where I drew my inspiration. It's about love. It's [a] big-hearted, warm record.

Adam: Mm hm.

Ed: And... every time I put my "Radiohead" head on this, it would get like: "What're you mentioning love about? Why're you-" You know. 

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: It's like... and I knew that... I had to let go of that. Because it would- wh- I just had to let go of it, and... that was quite hard to shake; and then you go 
back on tour, wi- you know, halfway through the record, you go on tour with the band, and - so you come back with a "Radiohead" head on, and it took, like, four weeks 
to get rid of it... to kind of, you know, to get in a place where... it was a "safe space."

Adam: ...Yeah.

Ed: Do you know, to do it. Do you know what I mean? It was...

Adam: Sure.

Ed: Because I wanted it to be a very direct and warm record, and very kind of open-hearted. And I... At the moment, I know that's not necessarily a very "Radiohead" thing. 
You know; Radiohead is... a lot more oblique, I think, and it's... sort of impressionist...? Whereas I wanted mine to be very direct and colorful and like, "BANG!"

Adam: Yeah.

Ed: You know? And open-hearted; with Radiohead, it's... you get the love, but it's not so... you know, it comes from a different beauty.

Adam: Yes...

Ed: D'you... If that makes sense...

Adam: Yeah, I'm trying to think of a... But, but I think you said it before, when you talked about Kubrick.

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: It's that sort of...

Ed: Yeah. It's a Kubrick thing!

Adam: It's a Kubrick thing...

Ed: Yeah! It really-

Adam: And you're... Now I'm trying to think of a director, who you are... Well, maybe it's the Nolan thing, isn't it?

Ed: Oh, come on! Give it to me! No, I mean, Nolan's done a lot of work; I'm the, I'm... [laughs] I'm the... [laughs] who directs them...

Adam: ...Radiohead is...

Ed: Kubrick...

Adam: ...is "Dr. Strangelove," and "2001"...

Ed: Yeah.

Adam: And you are...

Ed: Uh oh!

Adam: "Dude, Wheres's My Car?" [laughs]

Ed: [laughs loudly] Or "The Goonies!"

[Bowie's-"Space Oddity"-themed music break]

1:01:34
Adam: Hey, welcome back, podcats... Ed O'Brien there. There's a few links... in the description of this podcast; some bits and pieces that Ed and I spoke about. 
♫ What have we got for you? ♫

Link to the music video for Ed's excellent song "Brasil," from his album, "Earth"... 
Link to a YouTube playlist of bits and pieces from some of those "hacked" "OK Computer" MiniDiscs.. 
Link to a video of Ed, earlier this year, on YouTube... teaching you how to play "Creep," by Radiohead... 
"Only four chords," he reminds us. A fun one to pick up, if you're learning how to play guitar.
There is a link to... a not especially great quality of "Meeting People Is Easy," Grant Gee's 1998 Radiohead doc. 
That's on YouTube... That's probably one of those things which... will get taken down at some stage, but anyway, it's watchable; it's such a great doc; 
I would recommend - if you're a Radiohead fan and you haven't seen it - that you get hold of a decent quality copy.
There is a link to the only copy I could find of that early Radiohead video that we were talking about, "Stop Whispering" - the one with the old diving suit, and the pincushion... and Thom crouching between some girders, looking tortured.
Sadly, it seems that most of those official early Radiohead videos have been redacted from the internet. 
I couldn't even find bad quality copies of "Anyone Can Play Guitar," and things like that. 
But- Tch! Uhh, there's that list of the 100 greatest guitarists, by David Fricke, from 2010...

Also, there is a link to the Dan Hawkins online bass player site! If you're a regular podcat, then you will know that Dan Hawkins offers a[n] online bass playing service. 
You can send him a track, and he will lay down a bass part and send it back to you, brilliantly and efficiently.
I've used him... to provide bass for lots of the jingles in this podcast before, and today, it was the Star Trek jingle that Dan played bass over.
I didn't, of course, write the Star Trek music... What a great theme tune that is!
Anyway, there's a link to Dan Hawkins' online bass-playing site, should you... like to add a bit of great, old-fashioned, analogue, human bass playing to your track...

What else've we got? That's pretty much all the links- Oh no, there's a link to one of the things that has really cheered me up in the last few weeks...
...And that is a video of Robbie Williams playing a kind of "Scar" version of his song, "Angels"... on the Horne Section podcast.
Alex Horne, of Taskmaster fame, has a fantastic podcast that he does with his band, The Horne Section.
And, if you haven't heard the podcast before, I very much recommend it. It's great. They just- well, it's a combination of Alex's bordering on obsessive enthusiasm 
with turning everything into a game, and the brilliant improvising and comedy songwriting skills of his band, one of whom plays with the Robbie Williams' touring band.
So, they got Robbie to be a guest on one of their isolation specials; they recorded five, I think. Five episodes, earlier on in the lockdown...
And I only just got 'round to listening to them. [A] couple with Tim Key, who's always great value... One with Max Rushden, one with Rose Matafeo, and uhh... yeah, 
one with Robbie Williams, who is really good value. And just... committed, magnificently, to this, umm, rearranged version of "Angels" at the end, and it was so good.
And the video of them all... playing it remotely... on the... Zoom feeds, is... excellent as well.

What else? In about six weeks' time, I think... my book, Ramble Book, will finally be available in hardback, physical form... 
If you've already heard the audiobook - I've put links in the description for the podcast, obviously, to all these things - but... just because you've heard the audiobook 
doesn't mean to say that you can ignore the hardback. No, no, no, no, no. 
It's been beautifully designed for the physical thing! And... it's got pictures, and photographs, and... amazing illustrations from Helen Green, and... 
it's been laid out by genuises at Harper Collins... and it's a beautiful, lovingly-created object.
You can order a signed copy right now by visting the Waterstones' website - link in the description. It's uhh, there are a limited number of signed copies, 
so I don't guarantee that there will be one available... they may have sold out.
I'm just saying, that's a- it may happen. I didn't sign all /that/ many, so... make haste! Rosie! Come on, let's head back!

Ok, that's it for this week. Thank you very much, to Séamus Murphy-Mitchell, for his production support on this episode. 
Thanks to Matt Lamont for his increasingly brilliant edit whiz-bottery. 
Thanks to Ed O'Brien for his time, his good humour, his friendship, his musical skills... and, just everything. 
Thanks to Acast for supporting this, and other great, great podcasts. Why not check out the dizzying diversity of voices represented on their website?
Thanks to you, most especially, podcats. You listened right to the end! You're great, and I appreciate it.
And also, did you know that... well, I love you?
Byyyyye!
