# Transcriptions
Potentially, this is a repository for audio interviews that I have made unofficial transcriptions for.


This is meant to be a resource for easier referencing and searching for quotes, subjects, etc., that appear in interviews that are otherwise abstracted in audio form.


This is also meant to be an attempt to clarify the words in said interviews when the audio becomes difficult to discern, for non-native speakers, and for the hard of hearing.
